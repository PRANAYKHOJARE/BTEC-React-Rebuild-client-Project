## 🚀 Project Overview
This was a **paid freelance client project** where I handled the **end-to-end development lifecycle** — including UI/UX, component design, development, deployment, hosting, and domain mapping.

The platform was originally built in **HTML/CSS/JS**, but to support scalability and better lead generation, I **rebuilt the entire system using React.js**.
