## 🚀 Project Overview
This was a **paid freelance client project** where I handled the **end-to-end development lifecycle** —component design, development, deployment, hosting, and domain mapping.
BTEC Service is a corporate-business web platform built to showcase a wide range of industrial and field services (such as CCTV installation, electrical wiring, panel manufacturing, field maintenance, and more). After the client’s previous site proved outdated and static, I completely rebuilt the platform using React.js + Tailwind CSS, transforming it into a high-performance, responsive, and interactive website. The new version improves service presentation, enables secure lead capture via contact forms, integrates analytics for visitor tracking, and delivers seamless updates — offering a professional online presence that reflects modern business standards. The live site is accessible at btecservice.co.in.

The platform was originally built in **HTML/CSS/JS**, but to support scalability and better lead generation, I **rebuilt the entire system using React.js**.
